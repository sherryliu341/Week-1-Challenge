Week-1 Challenge
# Kickstarting with Excel
​
## Overview of Project
​ Louise wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals
### Purpose
​The purpose of this analysis is to visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals
## Analysis and Challenges
​
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
​the successful rate goes up till later May early June, after that, the rate goes down through the rest of the year. The failed rate is going on a similar pattern as the successful rate. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
​ the percentage successful is going down until the goal reaches between 30000 to 34999 and 40000 to 44999. the percentage goes down after that. The percentage failed is on an oppsite pattern of percventage successful. 
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
​In the “outcomes based on goals” exercise, I was not able to match my line graph to the one showing as the required document. By comparing the graph, I found the difference were “ number failed” at “40000 to 44999” and “45000 to 49999”. At first I kept looking for issues in the numbers columns not realizing the percentage was the one showing on the line chart. After changing the formular to the corrected ones, the line chart was matching the required document.  
## Results
​
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
​The successful rate goes down towards the end of the year. 
 The most successful time of the theater also comes with the highest failed rate.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
​ The most successful rate is when the goal is at 45000 to 49999
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
​ Numbers of the samples are too small. 
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
